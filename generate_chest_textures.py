"""Generate the village chest's clasp: vanilla's chest with a recoloured clasp.

The clasp is already the right shape for it. It is a small nub protruding from
the middle of the chest front, which is exactly what a villager's nose is, so
nothing needs remodelling: recolouring the metal to skin is the whole trick.
Vanilla's shading is preserved by mapping each grey it uses onto a skin tone of
matching lightness, which keeps the nub reading as a lit 3D shape rather than a
flat patch of colour.

Reads the three vanilla chest textures out of the Minecraft jar and writes the
recoloured copies. Pure stdlib (zlib + struct), no Pillow, deterministic:
re-running produces identical bytes. Same house pattern as the suite's other
icon generators.

Usage: python3 generate_village_chest.py
